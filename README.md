# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the Project
The focus of this project is a front-end server for the What to Wear (WTWR) application that assist users in deciding garment selections based on current local weather. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. User selections can be saved, retrieved, and deleted. The user's favorite garments can be marked using the Like feature that is also included.
